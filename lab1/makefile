# Name: Thomas Paris
# Project: lab1 - Time and Forking Children

# This is a Makefile for my lab assignment. It allows me to easily and accurately rebuild
# the lab assignment.


# EXECUTABLES is a Make Variable (similar to an environment variable) that lists all the
# "executables" associated with the lab. 
EXECUTABLES=time-4-baby-and-me
SRC=time-4-baby-and-me.c
OBJ=time-4-baby-and-me.o

# The CC and CFLAGS variables are defined to ensure I'm using the native compiler and
# that the correct command-line options are set
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-g

# Here is my default target for the Makefile.  When I type make, this first target will
# be created. I.e., all the executables
all: $(EXECUTABLES)


# On the following lines (which _must_ start with a tab), are the commands I need to type -- 
# each time my source file is modified.
$(EXECUTABLES): $(SRC)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(SRC)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(OBJ)

# By convention, I always have a target called
# "clean" that I used to define all temporary
# or intermediates.
clean:
	rm -f $(EXECUTABLES) $(OBJ) *~
